## What is Context Engineering?
Context engineering is the practice of designing, curating, and managing the information and metadata provided to AI systems to optimize their performance, reliability, and safety. While prompt engineering focuses on how you ask, context engineering focuses on what the AI knows and how it receives that knowledge.

## Why is Context Important?
- **Improves relevance and accuracy**: Supplying the right context helps the AI generate more precise and useful responses.
- **Reduces ambiguity**: Clear background information minimizes misunderstandings.
- **Mitigates hallucinations**: Proper context can prevent the AI from making up facts or going off-topic.
- **Enables personalization**: Context allows tailoring responses to specific users, domains, or tasks.

## Types of Context
- **Static Context**: Background information that remains constant during a session (e.g., company policies, product documentation).
- **Dynamic Context**: Information that changes during interaction (e.g., conversation history, user preferences, recent actions).
- **External Context**: Data fetched from APIs, databases, or external knowledge sources in real time.
- **Implicit Context**: Inferred information, such as user intent or emotional tone.

## Principles of Effective Context Engineering
- **Relevance**: Only provide information that is necessary for the task.
- **Clarity**: Structure context clearly—use sections, bullet points, or tables as needed.
- **Recency**: Keep dynamic context up to date.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent terminology and formatting.
- **Security & Privacy**: Avoid including sensitive or unnecessary personal data.

## Example: Context Engineering in Action
Suppose you are building an AI assistant for customer support:
- **Static Context**: Product manuals, support policies
- **Dynamic Context**: Current customer’s order status, recent chat history
- **External Context**: Live inventory data, shipping estimates

**Prompt Example:**
```
[Context]
Customer: Jane Doe
Order #: 12345
Product: Widget X
Issue: "My widget won't turn on."

[Task]
Provide troubleshooting steps and offer to escalate if unresolved.
```
